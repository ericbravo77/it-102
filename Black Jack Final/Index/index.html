<!--Created a Main function which is the onclick function for the "Create Deck button. This
function creates the 52 deck of cards in order. The Main function is composed of two functions
:the Create Deck function and the Manipulate Deck function. The Create Deck function forms the
the 52 deck object. It is composed of two classes: the Card class and the Deck class. The manipulate
deck function uses a "Switch" statemenet to evaluate a card variable. Depending on the  condition
of the variable, code is executed that creates an HTML image tag that contains an image of a card
to corresponds to the card variable. 
I created a scramble function which performs the shuffling of the deck object. It is onclick function
for the Shuffle button. This function is composed of the two functions: the "createDeck function" and the "shuffle Deck" 
function. -->
