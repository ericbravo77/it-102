  <!-- In order to model card games better, we need to have the code equivalent of a deck of cards. As a starting point towards this deck of cards, we should begin with a good card object. Your assignment today is to create and test a card object. Here some things your card object should have:

Create Card Function Constructor/Prototype.
Properties	Methods
Suit		show()
Rank		hide()
isVisible		
 -->
<!-- Instantiate at least 2 different cards. (You can call them card1 and card2, or something like that.) 
 Display the 2 cards to the web page with the Suit, Rank and isVisible values.
 Use the show() or hide() on both of the cards to change the "isVisible" object property.
 Again, display the 2 cards to the web page with the Suit, Rank and isVisible values to show the change.
Card Object

function Card(  ){

  //create the suit property and assign it the value from the parameter.

  //create the rank property and assign it the value from the parameter.

  //create the isVisible property and assign boolean false to it.

  //create the show() method.  This method assigns the boolean true to this.isVisible.

  //create the hide() method.  This method assigns the boolean false to this.isVisible. -->
